##
Setup
1. Get an API key from tmdb

Register an account: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Check out the API documentation: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Put the key in the TMDB_API_KEY environment variable

cd into the tagmkv directory and run tagmkv.py 
point it at some MKV files and you can set the metadata as presented in the UI. [CTRL+S] will save to the mkvfile.

This works for me and my layout, feel free to modify and send pull requests for enhancements/fixes.
